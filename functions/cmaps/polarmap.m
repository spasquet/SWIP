function cmap = polarmap(varargin)
%POLARMAP Polarized color map
%	POLARMAP applies a "polarized" blue-white-red colormap to current figure,
%	and adjusts the color axis limits to be centered to zero.
%
%	POLARMAP(M) fixes the number of colors to M (default is 64).
%
%	POLARMAP(MAP) applies linear shading to white to the center of colormap
%	MAP which can be any of existing colormaps (an Mx3 matrix of RGB).
%
%	POLARMAP(MAP,C) uses exponent C to modify the shading contrast. Default 
%	is C = 1 for linear shading. Use C = 2 to strengthen the shading, or 
%	C = 0.5 to attenuate it.
%
%	C=POLARMAP(...) returns an M-by-3 matrix containing the colormap, that 
%	can be used with COLORMAP function like other colormaps.
%
%	Examples:
%		pcolor(peaks), shading interp
%		polarmap, colorbar
%
%	then try the following
%		polarmap(jet,0.5)
%
%	Note the polar shading has no real interest with colormaps that include
%	white color as one of the extremes (like GRAY, BONE, HOT, ...).
%
%	See also JET, HSV, COPPER, SPRING, SUMMER, WINTER, COOL, COLORMAP, RGBPLOT.
