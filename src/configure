# I tried compiling seg2segy from SU repository (in $CWPROOT/src/Third_Party/seg2segy)
# As it didn't work right away in Ubuntu 24.04, I added the following code to seg2segy.c at line 122, and include the modified code in SWIP

# /* Forward declaration for swab function */
# #ifndef __MSDOS__
# void swab(const void *from, void *to, ssize_t n);
